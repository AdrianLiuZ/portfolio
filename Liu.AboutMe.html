					<p class="ab">My name is Adrian Liu, and I am a Senior who attends Dublin High.
					I was born in Hayward, California and I moved to Dublin when I was 2. 
					My contact info is <a href="Liu.Contact.html">this</a>. I am currently enrolled
					in Digital Electronics, a PLTW course that focuses on topics such as combinational and sequential logic 
					and I am exposed to circuit design tools, including logic gates, 
					integrated circuits, and programmable logic devices.

					<p class ="ab">My fascination for robotics and engineering began ever since I
					discovered the annual salary of an engineer. All jokes aside,
					my love for engineering stemmed from my curiosity about how things
					functioned. As a kid, I always wanted to know how each and everything
					worked. In order to do so, I would take apart and put back most
					mechanisms I could get my hands on. This fascination grew, it was
					now not only about how it functioned mechanically, but also about
					the software that allowed it to function. 
					I've been very interested in patterns and math. I would always beg 
					my parents to teach me more about this fascinating form of what I used to think was 'art'. This interest in math 
					and patterns led me to love problem solving. Problem solving allowed me to express myself, and being able to 
					successfully solve a problem gave me much joy. This love for problem solving led to my passion for programming and 
					physics. Both of these act as an outlet for me to solve anything I want! Other than school, I am also very passionate
					about golf, my family, and piano.</p>
