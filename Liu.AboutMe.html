					<p class="ab">My name is Adrian Liu, and I am a Senior who attends Dublin High.
					I was born in Hayward, California and I moved to Dublin when I was 2. 
					My contact info is <a href="Liu.Contact.html">this</a>. I am currently enrolled
					in Digital Electronics, a PLTW course that focuses on topics such as combinational and sequential logic 
					and I am exposed to circuit design tools, including logic gates, 
					integrated circuits, and programmable logic devices.
					</p>
					<p class ="ab">

					<p class ="ab">My fascination for robotics and engineering began ever since I was a child toying 
					with anything and everything I could get my hands on. I always wanted to know how each and everything
					worked. At a very young age, I would take apart and rebuild all of my toys, from
					the lego structures that I built to RC cars. My, honestly speaking, cliche fascination with 
					engineering lead me to robotics where I learned about what made most robots/electronics function, the 
					programming. An anecdote that sums up my fascination is as follows:</p>
					<p class ="ab">
					</p>
					<p class = "ab">
						"Finally!" I screamed, immediately my whole family rushed into my room to inquire what had happened. They huddled around my chair and leaned towards my computer screen. All they saw were dots moving in a line. 
					</p>
					<p class = "ab">
					Puzzled, they asked, "what is that?".
					</p>
					<p class = "ab">
					"The game, Snake, obviously". 
					</p>
					<p class = "ab">
					Despite the simplicity of the game, the "aha" moment from solving the bug after several days brought so much joy that I could not help but to scream. Be it robotics, the science fair, my internship, or any small projects, engineering has been an outlet for me to express 
					my creativity in problem-solving. I plan on continuing my interests in programming and problem solving at the University of California San Diego in the Fall.
