				<h2 class = 'center'>MIT app inventor Project: Mini Golf</h2>
				<p class = 'center'>
				The MIT app inventor project is a project where we had to take a code that was mainly finished.
				Then finish the code and add some variation to the original game. We worked on this project in CSE class. 
				A class that is provided in Dublin High. We were able to work with a partner on this project.
				What we did to change the original app is that we made the controls much smoother. Second, we added more obsticles such as
				water, and sand. After I finished this project, skills that I learned were problem solving and leadership. I learned problem solving
				from being able to fix the bugs that this game came with. I learned leadership from yelling and Nuha and telling her what to do(minus the yelling part). 
				The dates of this project and our app logs are accessable by clicking the picture. You will be able to download the app on your computer with the .aia
				and download it on an android device with the .apk. The download links are on the bottom of the page.</p>

				<h2 class = 'center'>Python Text Adventure: Corrupted Kingdom</h2>
				<p class = 'center'>
				Python Text Adventure was the first Python project assigned in CSE. The goal of this project is to
				create a text adventure(game) that allows the user to go through a journey. And depending on the choices
				they choose, the story changes. We worked on this project with the person sitting next to us, my partner
				was Jacob. My partner and I created a kingdom themed text adventure, where you are a normal peasant who
				has a choice to overthrow a corrupted kingdom. This adventure allows you to choose between 3 classes and
				allows you to choose what ability you would like to choose. Throughout this project, I was able to see the 
				importance of a partner. At the begginning of the project, I would rarely communicate and just code what I wanted.
				However, without communicating, I realized that I'm horrible at making a story. So, through communicating I was
				able to code a story that was actually tangible. After this project, I learned that a partner is very useful,
				and that communication is key to a successful code. You can access our project log by clicking the picture of a 
				text adventure game.</p>

				<h2 class = 'center'>Hangman Mini Project</h2>
				<p class = 'center'>
				The hangman project was a mini project assigned in CSE. This project's goal was to create a somewhat working 
				hangman game in one week. We were able to pick a partner, and I picked Aryan Jadhav. The goal was to first finish
				the base of the game, which is the code that actually uses guess and secret to create a string with '--- ---'. Then after
				we finish that, we then were supposed to add a theme and make the game more user friendly. On the first day of this project,
				we were able to successfully make the game work. However, when I got back home, I coudln't control myself, and I worked on the rest
				of the code without Aryan. I was able to finish the whole code. However, when I arrived to class, we had to show Mr.Brown part 2 of
				the game, which I deleted since I was able to complete. This was a huge mistake, since by working on it over the weekend, Aryan was
				not able to understand anything I did. Because of that, I had to redo the code with him. After this project, I learned that you have to
				work with your partner, and through working with my partner, I was able to learn by teaching. To see our hangman code, please click

				<h2 class = 'center'>Entreprenuership Project(Physical therapy App)</h2>
				<p class = 'center'>
				The Entreprenuership Project was a huge end of the year project that was assigned in CSE. The goal of this project was to test
				our entreprenuership capabilites. We were able to choose partners between all engineering classes, and with them, we had to come up
				with a "revolutionary" idea that can be easily marketed and appeals to a lot of people. My partners on this project were: Addison Shiu,
				Harsha Jagarlamudi, Sam Toma. Together, we create PTA(Physical Therapy App), which is an app that allows you to track your physical therapy
				progress. You can also enter your information such as age, height, and weight, and the current injury. With this informaiton, the app uses its
				algorithms to calculate what exercises you should do to help improve your current condition. The therapy process also comes with a built in timer to
				keep track of each of your exercises. When you log out before the whole exercise is done, the app will save what step you were on and what time it was
				so when you come back to the application, it will continue where you left off. Due to the time restraints, we were not able to accomplish everything we
				wanted to do such as: a video that describes step by step procedures, more parameters, be able to contact your physical therapist whenever if 
				you need any help. After finishing this project, I was able to learn how to work with a team(though this is the skill that I usually learn), 
				by working as a team, I learned that some projects can't be done with a one person team. I also learned how to listen to others opinions and ideas,
				and not let their ideas go from one ear to the other. To see our documentation of our project click the image directly above, if you would like

					The Solar Hydrogen vehicle project was a huge project that tested how well we worked as a team. This project 
					was assigned in my POE(Principles of Engineering) course during my sophomore year of Dublin High School. We were 
					placed in teams of 3-4(I worked with Alicia Chen, Dhiraj Koppanathi, and Arina Sobol)
					and were tasked to create a vehicle for tesla that can help them inquire more knowledge
					about solar and hydrogen fuel cells. We were given VEX materials in order to create a mini vehicle that is powered
					by one of the cells. Then we were to record the time it took for the vehicle to travel 1 meter on a certain power 
					source. The one major constraint that we came across was the size limits, your vehicle can only be 12 inches by 5 inches.
					This was an issue since our original design of the motors being directly attached to the wheel would not work. What we 
					did to overcome this obstacle was creating an elevated platform where the motor can power a sprocket which is linked
					to another sprocket on the front driving wheels by a chain. My main role during this project was to facilitate
					my team and keep them on track, and to build the actual vehicle. After finishing this project, I was able to better
					myself as a builder and I grew in my understanding of how vehicles and even VEX functioned. Another very important skill 
					I was able to imporve was to keep calm when situations seemed bleak. The day right before the whole project was due, our vehicle 
					somehow didn't function like normally, it would jitter and was virutally imobile. However, Dhiraj and I both calmed down 
					and were able to fix the issue together as a team. If you would like to reach our documentation of this project please click

					The Aerodynamic design project was a huge project that evaluated how well we worked with a team on a physical design
					that was tested and comapred with others. This project was assined in my POE(Principles of Engineering) course during
					my sophomore year of Dublin High School. In this project, we were allowed to select our own team and I chose Uday Kalra
					and Nicholas Talin. In this project, we were tasked to create a projectile that can be launched with the given
					launchers. The way the projectiles were evaluated was the distance it traveled vs the amount of time it took to land. The 
					projectiles were made with paper that was rolled around a 3/4" PVC pipe which allowed the projectile to fit onto
					the launcher. The launcher was made from a bike bump that increased pressure on a reservoir and is released to propell the 
					projectile forward. The first design I made was very simple, it was a 12" tube that had wings at the end of it. It faired quite 
					well, going roughly 45 yards, however, compared to the other projectiles, it wasn't up to par. Then I began to lighten up 
					the body of the projectile and slightly increase the weight of the tip. I also reinforced the wings to increase stability since
					the previous test was very unstable. Through this project, I was able to learn much more about learning from my 
					mistakes and fixing them. To access our decomentation for this project, please click

					The AOI Circuit project was a in Digital Electronics where a teamate and I were tasked
					brainstorm, design, and build a circuit (with a well thought out purpose) that utilizes
					6 different inputs. I teamed up with Andrew Hoffman and we set out to build a game of 
					hide and seek. This game requires 2 players, one hides and one seeks. The hider has 3 inputs 
					which represents the 3 different spots that he/she can hide. The seeker has 3 inputs as well which
					corresponds to the 3 other inputs that the hider has. The hider chooses at least 1 input and the 
					seeker attempts to guess which inputs were inputted. There were quite a lot of problems when I 
					attempted to create the circuit. One of the main issues stemmed from the loose breadboard which
					caused all the issues regarding the ICs popping out. This caused issues with the different outputs
					not coming in correctly because the gates did not function. I was able to fix this mistake
					by testing each individual minterm. Through this project, I was able to learn much more about learning from my 
					mistakes and fixing them. To access our decomentation for this project, please click

						Project 235 was a project assigned in my digital electronics class at Dublin
						High School. This project was assigned right after I learned about a programmable
						logic device (PLD) which is a device that allows the engineer to program and store 
						complex logic (that would normally take hundreds of wires) into this 2-3 inch 
						device. In this project, I was tasked to use the PLD to create a banner that is 
						16 letters in length. The PLD cycles through 16 different logics gates that return
						different outputs, each corresponding to a specific segment on the Mydaq's built-in 
						seven segment display. My breadboard cycled through each of the 16 characters and 
						spelled out "Hippity Hoppity". The 2 most challenging parts of this project were: (1) correctly 
						linking each logic condition for every letter with the corresponding segment and (2)
						finding the perfect clock frequency so that the letters are cycling at the perfect pace.
